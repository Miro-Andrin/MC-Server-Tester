# MC Server Testing
This folder contains an attempt at testing the perfomance and functionality of feather-rs compared to other servers. It is therefor a generic utillity meant to work on any minecraft server implementation. We therefor dont include any feather specific code, instead opting for tools that inspect prosesses, or that inspect minecraft world files after terminating the servers.  


# Outline of first goal
The first goal i want to achive with this utility is to create a nice python libary for creating servers and modifying their settings.


# Important note
Some of the servers (like spigot) want to make sure you only use their software if you agree to mojangs eula. I therefor kindley ask you not to use any of the included softeare to administer a minecraft server. This tool is only meant for automated testing.
